So, I just switched over to use [Jekyll](http://http://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host and create this blog (from WordPress).  There was definitely a bit of a learning curve, but I could not be happier with the results! From its outward appearance, it doesn't look like much (yet), but it's been great to be able to get inside the nuts and bolts, and to be able to control all aspects of my blog's production and creation!

I'm using the [Skinny Bones](http://mmistakes.github.io/skinny-bones-jekyll/) demo, which is a great starting point.  Be on the lookout for a lot more improvements soon!
