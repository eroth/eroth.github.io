Hex Sells was done entirely using open source software.  It is powered by the Ruby gem [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) and the amazing [Minimal Mistakes](https://mademistakes.com/work/minimal-mistakes-jekyll-theme/) template.  It is hosted through [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), was developed with the text editor [Atom](https://atom.io/), the Markdown editor [MacDown](https://macdown.uranusjr.com/), and uses fonts from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
